# NECC-Species-Distribution-Summaries

## Overivew
This repository supports analysis of the NOAA NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science Center spring and fall bottom trawl survey data to calculate a suite of metrics summarizing the spatial and temporal distribution of ~40 focal species. Ultimately, these spatial and temporal distribution summaries will be used to see if there are relationships among changes in spatial distribution and changes in marine species diet as part of the NSF funded Nutritional Ecology of Climate Change Project with folks from UNH. 

## Navigating the Repo
*Should think about adding something here about how to interact with the repository and then how it relates back to anything on Box or elsewhere*
