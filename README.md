## Nutrional ecology of climate change

### Species distibution change, seasonal variability, and dietary responses.

#### Overview

This repository supports analysis of the NOAA NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science Center spring and fall bottom trawl survey data to calculate a suite of metrics summarizing the spatial and temporal distribution of \~40 focal species. Ultimately, these spatial and temporal distribution summaries will be used to see if there are relationships among changes in spatial distribution and changes in marine species diet as part of the NSF funded Nutritional Ecology of Climate Change Project with folks from UNH.

#### Data

This folder contains the list of fishes included in the NECC study as well as the Rds and RData workspace associated with this project.

#### R

Within the folder there are two subfolders entitled **NECC** and **Continuing work scripts.**

**NECC** contains four R files from late 2021,

-   `helper_funcs.R`
-   `01_SurveyDataPrep.R`
-   `02_SpeciesDistAnalysis.R`
-   `03_Plotting_Mapping.R`

These analyses have since been updated with the most recent trawl survey data and are summarised in the following markdown:

-   [Species profiles](https://carlylovas.github.io/NECC-Species-Distribution-Summaries/R/NECC%20scripts/Updated_Species_Dist.html)

**Continuing work scripts** contains multiple markdowns for predator/prey overlap and seasonal variability analyses.

-   [Movement classifications](https://carlylovas.github.io/NECC-Species-Distribution-Summaries/R/Continuing%20work%20scripts/movement.html)
-   [Overlap metrics](https://carlylovas.github.io/NECC-Species-Distribution-Summaries/R/Continuing%20work%20scripts/overlap.html)
-   [Seasonal migration](https://carlylovas.github.io/NECC-Species-Distribution-Summaries/R/Continuing%20work%20scripts/seasonal_migration.html)
-   [Linear mixed model](https://carlylovas.github.io/NECC-Species-Distribution-Summaries/R/Continuing%20work%20scripts/trawl_yearday.html)

#### Temp Results

There are three folders: **Plots**, **Maps** and **Tables**. These folders contain output results from former species distibution analyses and have *not* been updated since 2022.
